## Business Activities
### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
HTB identifies itself as a specialist bank (https://www.htb.co.uk/). One may define a specialist bank as a smaller bank that customizes and tailors its services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html). A specialist bank solves the problems faced by SMEs in dealing with larger banks (https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html). Specifically, according to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "Too often, smaller enterprises do not meet the strict lending criteria set out by some of these larger banks, and this has increasingly driven demand for more customisable solutions.In turn this has paved the way for the emergence of alternative finance providers and the wave of specialist banks. These new finance options bring with them a diversification of products to service those businesses thathave largely been neglected by bigger UK banking institutions."
### What is the company’s intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of clients? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer (what is the unfair advantage that this bank utilizes)?
HTB's intended customer is the individual and the SME. According to https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/British-Business-Bank-Small-Business-Finance-Markets-Report-2015-16.pdf through https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "Some 60% of SMEs seeking bank finance still only approach only one provider, whilearound 90% of SMEs go to their main business current account bank for overdrafts, general purpose business loans and credits cards." In terms of competitive edge, according to https://www.fintechmagazine.com/brochure/hampshire-trust-bank-using-digital-transformation-improve-human-interaction-not-replace-it, HTB leverages a combination of close analysis of client needs (from intimate working relationships) and a specially tailored application programming interface (API) from partners.
### Which Technologies Is This Bank Currently Using, and How Is This Bank Implementing Them?
Recently, HTB has touted its technology partnerships with such firms as Matillion, InterWorks, and Snowflake, Incorporated in terms of forming a data and artificial-intelligence led analytical platform and dashboard (https://www.htb.co.uk/insights/htb-positions-data-at-the-heart-of-decision-making-with-tech-investments/). However, in terms of leveraging the above-mentioned API system, HTB relies on technology from three (3) firms: Phoebus, APA, ICA Consultancy.
#### Phoebus
According to https://www.phoebus.co.uk/solutions/, "Phoebus is a real time system, as all actions have immediate effect. So you can make better-informed decisions, more quickly. Because of its built-in flexibility, Phoebus allows you to react rapidly to changing market needs. It automates so much of your administration, too: creating letters and documents, and integrated with a document imaging system.

We've done it for four decades and we're still innovating. Our teams provide integrated business consultancy and IT services to ensure our clients' commercial aspirations are met – and exceeded."
#### ICA Consultancy
According to https://icaconsultancy.co.uk/services-assist/cisoaas/, ICA states that "As part of our Assist services the Chief Information Security Officer-as-a-Service (CISOaaS) provides access to the capabilities required to respond to the threats of today and plan for those of tomorrow. For some organisations hiring a Chief Information Security Officer is simply cost prohibitive, and for others attracting and retaining the right talent is challenging. Either way, the impact of a cyber-attack or data breach can still be significant. Often what is required is simply access to the right capabilities at the right time."
## Landscape
### In what domain of the financial industry is the company?
HTB operates in the domain of specialist banking. According to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, specialist banks "offer specific lending products and a more personalised service is what stands [us] apart when it comes to choosing a finance provider." In addition, according to https://www.financedigest.com/the-rise-of-the-specialist-bank.html, "specialist banks have firmly solidified their place in the future of finance by fostering competition and improving choice for customers. Also, our view is that SMEs value long-term relationships with lenders they can rely on to support them through the cycle."
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last five to ten (5-10) years?
According to https://specialistbanking.co.uk/article-desc-7322_Believe%20the%20hype%20%E2%80%93%20why%20explainable%20AI%20is%20a%20trend%20that%E2%80%99s%20here%20to%20stay, the latest and most dominant trend is "explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)." The article states that "The banking sector, like every other, is feeling the pressing need to move towards bespoke solutions with greater transparency — as a result, there is increased appetite to leverage the power that XAI can bring to banking. The use of AI in decision making has received criticism recently for its perceived biases and lack of transparency surrounding its outcomes. There has also been some scepticism among consumers, who can be reticent to share their personal data. Yet it is only in doing so that they can receive the personalised services they crave and that provide them with what they actually need. Fortunately, XAI models can help overcome these concerns, illustrating to customers the value in sharing their data, while also reassuring them that it will be used in an appropriate and non-biased way" (https://specialistbanking.co.uk/article-desc-7322_Believe%20the%20hype%20%E2%80%93%20why%20explainable%20AI%20is%20a%20trend%20that%E2%80%99s%20here%20to%20stay).
